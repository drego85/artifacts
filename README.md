**artifacts** is a CLI toolkit for static triage of suspicious APKs. It surfaces known strings, network indicators, manifest permissions/anomalies, and suggests likely malware families by comparing the findings against a LiteJDB dataset. Use it for the very first pass before switching to heavyweight tools such as Jadx, Bytecode-Viewer, or dynamic sandboxes.

## Key Features

- **Robust extraction** – `apkInspector.headers.ZipEntry` lets us unpack obfuscated or tampered APKs directly inside the working temp folder, avoiding the limitations of Python's `zipfile`.
- **Manifest decoding** – `apkInspector.axml.parse_apk_for_manifest` decodes `AndroidManifest.xml` even when it is still in binary form, so we can read permissions/applicationId without fully expanding the archive.
- **String & IOC hunting** – regexes for Base64, URLs/IPs, Telegram IDs, plus curated network/root indicators stored in `data/*.json`.
- **Similarity scoring** – compares the extracted permission/application sets against the LiteJDB database (`data/patterns.json`) to suggest the closest family match.
- **Actionable reports** – `-r` builds a structured JSON report, `-s` prints similarity tables, `--activity` dumps the decoded manifest details.

> ℹ️ **Disclaimer**: outputs are heuristics meant for triage and can produce false positives. Always confirm with additional tooling or manual review.

## apkInspector Integration

This project relies on [apkInspector](https://github.com/erev0s/apkInspector) to reliably unpack APKs even when the ZIP structure is malformed or heavily obfuscated, and to decode `AndroidManifest.xml` straight from the package so permissions and components remain readable.

## Requirements & Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/guelfoweb/artifacts.git
cd artifacts
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # recommended
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Main dependencies:

- Python 3.10+
- [apkInspector](https://github.com/erev0s/apkInspector)
- [LiteJDB](https://github.com/guelfoweb/litejdb)
- prettytable

## Quick Start

```bash
# Full help
python3 artifacts.py -h

# Run analysis + JSON report + similarity table
python3 artifacts.py sample.apk -r -s

# List every family stored in LiteJDB
python3 artifacts.py --list-all
```

Sample output (truncated):

```json
{
  "version": "1.1.4",
  "md5": "ab879f4e8f9cf89652f1edd3522b873d",

  "network": {
    "ip": ["1.1.1.1", "8.8.8.8"],

  },
  "string": {

  },
  "family": {
    "name": "SpyNote Italy 10/2023",
    "match": 100.0
  }
}
```

### How family matching works

- **Feature extraction** – `lib/manifest.py` parses the decoded manifest and normalizes the three indicator buckets (`permission`, `application`, `intent`) as alphabetically sorted lists.
- **Family dataset** – each entry in `data/patterns.json` provides the expected indicators for a known malware family. When you run `artifacts.py … -s`, the CLI loads this dataset via LiteJDB.
- **Per-bucket scoring** – for every family we compute the [Jaccard similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) between the APK bucket and the family bucket (e.g., `permission_score = |perm_apk ∩ perm_family| / |perm_apk ∪ perm_family| * 100`). The same formula is applied to `application` and `intent`.
- **Final score** – the reported `family.match` is the arithmetic mean of the three bucket scores (all equally weighted). The `family.value` object surfaces the individual bucket percentages so you can tell *why* a match ranked higher (e.g., strong intent overlap but few shared permissions).
- **Interpreting the report** – identical APK permissions can still yield different percentages if the top-ranked family changes, because each family contributes its own reference set. Log the similarity table (`-s`) to compare how your indicators intersect with multiple candidates.

## CLI Commands

| Flag | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `-h, --help` | Show the inline help. |
| `-v, --version` | Print the tool version. |
| `-r, --report` | Emit a structured JSON report. |
| `-s, --similarity` | Display the similarity table against the family DB. |
| `-a, --activity` | Dump decoded manifest activities/permissions. |
| `-l, --list-all` | List all families tracked in LiteJDB. |
| `--del NAME` | Remove a family from the DB. |
| `--add NAME` | Add the currently analyzed APK to the DB under `NAME`. |

## Datasets & Reporting

- **`data/patterns.json`** – defines known families, expected permissions, and application names. Updating this file improves matching without touching the Python code.
- **`data/permission_categories.json` / `permission_description.json`** – provide human-readable descriptions used in reports.
- The `-r` flag outputs category-based JSON (LOCATION, NETWORK, etc.) that can be pasted into tickets or knowledge bases.

## Contributing

1. Open an issue describing the bug/feature.
2. Work in a dedicated branch (e.g., `feature/apk-inspector-upgrade`).
3. Run the core commands (`python3 artifacts.py sample.apk -r -s`, `--list-all`) and attach the output to your PR.
4. Use imperative commit messages (e.g., `Add apkInspector extraction`).
